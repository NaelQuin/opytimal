# Opytimal - Python/FEniCS framework to solve optimal control PDE-based problems
Opytimal is a Python/FEniCS framework that hav the main goal solve Optimal Control problems considering multiple and mixed controls based to linear and nonlinear PDEs, in addition to can also solve PDEs with mixed boundary conditions simply and clearly.
